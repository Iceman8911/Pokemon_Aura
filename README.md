# Coloured Battle Text Effectiveness
This is just the implemented version of [**Coloured Battle Text**](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10167016&postcount=83). It shows a different colored text of the element of a move in-battle (By Default: Super Effective - Green, Not Very Effective - Red, Not Effective at all - Faded Gray). It also supports Inverse and Double/Multi Battles.

The colours of the text can be edited in "src/battle_message.c". Just search for the line with the comment "//For coloured battle text" in the struct "sTextOnWindowsInfo_Normal" .

STAB moves also have a different text too (somewhat smaller and wider than normal) but are currently being worked on.
Moves like Counter, Mirror Coat, Metal Burst, Seismic Toss, Night Shade, etc can show as super effective, not very effective,etc. I'll fix this later.
