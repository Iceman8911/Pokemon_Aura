# Coloured Battle Text Effectiveness

This is an implementaion based of a somewhat outdated (some stuff got shifted around since then) pokecommunity post about [**Coloured Type Effectiveness In-Battle Text**](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10167016&postcount=83). It shows a different colored text of the element of a move in-battle (By Default: Super Effective - Green, Not Very Effective - Red, Not Effective at all - Faded Gray). It also supports Inverse and Double/Multi Battles.

The colours of the text can be edited in "src/battle_message.c". Just search for the line with the comment "//For coloured battle text" in the struct "gTextOnWindowsInfo_Normal" .


## To do
1. Moves like Counter, Mirror Coat, Metal Burst, Seismic Toss, Night Shade, etc can show as super effective, not very effective,etc. I'll fix this later.  ---- DONE
2. Compatibility with type-immune abilities (I kinda have mixed feelings with this since it automatically reveals the opponents ability to you).

## Note
I had a previous implementation similar to [**what I referenced earlier**](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10167016&postcount=83). You can pull all previous commits till the comit with this SHA a6f851da02e0ffe1b91612f13461b8481bdf51d6.
